- **Parent email registration** for account setup and oversight
- **n8n workflow integration** for conversation logging and content moderation
- **User session management** with automatic conversation timeouts
- **Content filtering pipeline** through automated backend workflows

## Game Flow

1. **Parent Setup**: Parents provide email address during initial game launch
2. **Room Exploration**: Children freely explore the interactive playroom environment
3. **Character Discovery**: Find and approach Lulu to see interaction prompts
4. **Voice Conversations**: Press interaction key to start natural voice chat with AI responses
5. **Ambient Experience**: Lulu continues exploring and animating when conversations end

## Technical Implementation

### Voice Chat System
The project implements a sophisticated real-time voice chat system:

```csharp
// Core voice chat component with WebSocket streaming
ElevenLabsVoiceChat voiceChat = GetComponent<ElevenLabsVoiceChat>();
voiceChat.StartConversation(); // Opens WebSocket to ElevenLabs agent
```

**Audio Processing Pipeline:**
- Microphone capture ‚Üí 16kHz resampling ‚Üí Base64 encoding ‚Üí WebSocket transmission
- ElevenLabs response ‚Üí PCM decoding ‚Üí Audio ring buffer ‚Üí Unity AudioSource playback

### Character Animation System
Lulu features a comprehensive animation system with multiple behavioral states:

```csharp
// Animation manager handling ambient behaviors and conversation states  
LuluAnimationManager animManager = GetComponent<LuluAnimationManager>();
animManager.StartConversation(); // Switches to conversation-focused behavior
```

**Animation States:**
- **Idle Variations**: Random actions like picking up items, looking around, turning
- **Movement**: Walking between waypoints with pathfinding
- **Conversation**: Faces player and maintains attention during chat
- **Transitions**: Smooth state changes between behavioral modes

### Interaction System
Built on Unity's component-based architecture with clear interfaces:

```csharp
// Interaction interface implementation for consistent object behavior
public class LuluInteractable : MonoBehaviour, IInteractable
{
    public void OnInteract(GameObject player) 
    { 
        // Start or end conversation based on current state
    }
}
```

## Backend Integration

### n8n Workflow Automation
Three core workflows handle data processing and safety:

1. **Conversation Storage**: Logs all chat sessions with timestamps and user context
2. **User Context Management**: Handles user identification and conversation history retrieval  
3. **Content Moderation**: Real-time safety monitoring and inappropriate content flagging

### Data Flow Architecture
